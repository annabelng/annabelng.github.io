My brother always recommends me different books to read, but this is the first one I picked up the same day he told me to read it (rather than waiting a couple months or a year haha…). Honestly, I really liked this book. I came in not knowing what to expect, wondering how a book could possibly relate to the problem of three gravitational bodies in orbit, but I came away pleasantly surprised with how it talked about nuances of the Cultural Revolution as well as humanity and morality.</p> <p>The Three Body Problem was also cool in how it wove together the characters’ plotlines so seamlessly. Although I was a bit confused at the start, I legitimately had some jaw dropping moments when different characters’ true backstories and motives were revealed. I’m excited to start reading The Dark Forest and will update with my thoughts!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="books"/><category term="reviews"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thoughts on the first book in the trilogy by Liu Cixin]]></summary></entry></feed>
