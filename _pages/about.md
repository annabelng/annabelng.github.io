Hello! I'm Annabel, an EECS major at UC Berkeley excited about applying machine learning to solve challenging vision and language problems. Currently, I’m a machine learning engineering intern at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/), where I’m developing innovative tools to secure internal Wiki systems and streamline support ticket assignment.

At Berkeley, I'm involved with computer vision research for autonomous F1 cars at [ROAR](https://roar.berkeley.edu/), which is the top US Indy Autonomous Racing team, as well as efficient image encoding research at the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/research/). I'm also passionate about improving the accessibility of machine learning education at [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/), where I've hosted introductory ML workshops for underrepresented high school students and created content for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608) and IBM.

On the side, you can find me curating playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/wl2d8bv1f8n4h8p76jec96mg9?si=EPiCNc0JTbec1bWqhyGYUg), learning new songs on my guitar, or watching Studio Ghibli movies. If any of this interests you, feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:annabelng@berkeley.edu)!
