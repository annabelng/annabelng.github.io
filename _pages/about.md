Hello! I'm Annabel, an EECS major at UC Berkeley. My interests include applying machine learning to the healthcare space and improving our communities with technology. At Berkeley, I'm involved with [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/) as well as computational neuroscience research at the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/research/). 

Currently, I'm working with the Sirota Lab at UCSF on predicting preterm birth with microbiome data. Previously, I've worked as a digital strategy intern at the nonprofit [Give Essential](https://www.giveessential.org/) and StudentTech at the [UCSD Super Computer center](https://education.sdsc.edu/studenttech/). 

On the side, you can find me curating playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/wl2d8bv1f8n4h8p76jec96mg9?si=EPiCNc0JTbec1bWqhyGYUg), learning new songs on my guitar, or watching Studio Ghibli movies. If any of this interests you, feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:annabelng@berkeley.edu)!
