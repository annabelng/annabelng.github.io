Hello! I'm Annabel, an EECS major at UC Berkeley and an incoming machine learning engineering intern at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/). At Berkeley, I'm involved with [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/) as well as theoretical neuroscience research at the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/research/). 

Previously, I've worked as a project engineer intern at [Cubic Transportation Systems](https://www.cubic.com/transportation), where I developed a full-stack dashboard to monitor 300 devices in the Boston MBTA transportation system. I also explored the predictive ability of the microbiome for preterm birth as a student researcher in the [Sirota Lab](https://sirotalab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. 

On the side, you can find me curating playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/wl2d8bv1f8n4h8p76jec96mg9?si=EPiCNc0JTbec1bWqhyGYUg), learning new songs on my guitar, or watching Studio Ghibli movies. If any of this interests you, feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:annabelng@berkeley.edu)!
