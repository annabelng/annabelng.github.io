Hello! I'm Annabel, a first-year EECS major at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in applying machine learning to the healthcare space. Currently, I'm working with the Sirota Lab at UCSF on predicting preterm birth with microbiome data. Previously, I've worked as a digital strategy intern at the nonprofit [Give Essential](https://www.giveessential.org/) and StudentTech at the [UCSD Super Computer center](https://education.sdsc.edu/studenttech/). 

When I'm not coding, you can find me curating playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/wl2d8bv1f8n4h8p76jec96mg9?si=EPiCNc0JTbec1bWqhyGYUg), going on runs, or watching Studio Ghibli movies. Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:annabelng@berkeley.edu)!
