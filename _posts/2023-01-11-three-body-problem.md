My first book of 2023 was **The Three Body Problem** by Liu Cixin. My brother always recommends me different books to read, but this is the first one I picked up the same day he told me to read it (rather than waiting a couple months or a year haha...). Honestly, I really liked this book. I came in not knowing what to expect, wondering how a book could possibly relate to the problem of three gravitational bodies in orbit, but I came away pleasantly surprised with how it talked about nuances of the Cultural Revolution as well as humanity and morality. 

The Three Body Problem was also cool in how it wove together the characters' plotlines so seamlessly. Although I was a bit confused at the start, I legitimately had some jaw dropping moments when different characters' true backstories and motives were revealed. I'm excited to start reading The Dark Forest and will update with my thoughts!
